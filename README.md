# Project 6 of 6 for Android-Basics-Nanodegree by Google.

This copyright applies to ALL projects coded by myself, and not the four practice applications used in the Udacity lectures.

Google's Android Basics Nanodegree course is presented through Udacity.com by Google software engineers. 
They use distant learning to teach Android Development through java object-oriented proggraming.
Learners participate in practice apps, quizes, and researh.
Learners need to pass 6 projects to graduate before a predetermined end date.

All projects are build with Gradle in AndroidStudio, Google's own IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and written in Java. I recommend Intellij IDEA, as an alternative IDE. The reason being that both IDEs are maintained by the Intellij IDEA Community, thus providing almost identical proggraming capabilities.

ABND Practice Apps:
1. Birthday Card [XML Layout]
2. Just Java [Java Proggraming]
3. Miwok Language [Content Hosted Internally]
4. Quake Report [HTTP Networking & APIs]

The applications mentioned above equipped learners with skills and knowledge to build the required projects needed to pass.

ABND Projects:
1. Business Card App [Single Screen]
2. Scorekeeper App
3. Quiz App
4. Music Structure App [Multi-Screen]
5. Tour Guide App
6. News App [HTTP Networking & APIs]

The applications mentioned above are the 6 mandatory course projects to pass.

This repository displays my coding ability and should not be used by future learners as templates, but may be used as a reference to assist learners in writing their own code. Your hard work will be rewarded.
